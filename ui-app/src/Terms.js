          Legal Disclaimer:
          <br></br>
          <ul>
          Welcome to our Space Travel E-commerce Website! Before you embark on your cosmic journey, please take a moment to review the following important legal disclaimers:
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Ticket Purchase Acknowledgement:
          <br></br>
          By purchasing a ticket through our website, you acknowledge that you're about to embark on an extraordinary adventure beyond the bounds of Earth. Buckle up and get ready for an out-of-this-world experience!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Space Travel Risks:
          <br></br>
          Space travel isn't your typical Sunday stroll. You may encounter asteroids, alien civilizations, and the occasional black hole. While we've taken every precaution to ensure your safety, please be aware that space is vast, and the unexpected might happen. You're in for a ride!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Zero-Gravity Etiquette:
          <br></br>
          In the weightlessness of space, what goes up might just float away! Please refrain from tossing your belongings around like confetti. Our crew will appreciate it, and so will your fellow travelers.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Alien Encounter Protocol:
          <br></br>
          Should you encounter extraterrestrial life forms during your voyage, remember the three R's: Remain calm, respect their space, and resist the urge to challenge them to a game of intergalactic chess. Our legal team advises against it.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Restaurant at the End of the Universe Clause:
          <br></br>
          While we can't promise you'll find the fabled Restaurant at the End of the Universe, we can assure you that our in-flight dining options are stellar. From freeze-dried delicacies to space-age cocktails, we've got your taste buds covered across the cosmos.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Time Dilation Disclaimer:
          <br></br>
          Due to the effects of time dilation, your journey may seem to pass at different speeds relative to Earth. Don't worry if you return home to find your pet turtle has become a centenarian. Time flies when you're traveling at warp speed!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Return Trip Guarantee:
          <br></br>
          Rest assured, we'll get you back home safe and sound. However, if you do happen to stumble upon a wormhole leading to an alternate dimension, kindly refrain from activating it without consulting our flight crew first. We have schedules to keep!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Legal Jurisdiction:
          <br></br>
          In the unlikely event of a legal dispute arising from your space travel experience, please note that all matters shall be resolved under the jurisdiction of the Intergalactic Court of Cosmic Justice. Their gavels are made of stardust, and their verdicts are as immutable as the laws of physics.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          By proceeding with your ticket purchase, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined above. Bon voyage, intrepid traveler! Together, we'll explore the final frontier and beyond.
